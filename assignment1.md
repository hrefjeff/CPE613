# 1. Do you have any questions about the syllabus? If so, what are they?

None so far.

# 2. What do you seek to gain from this course? Are you taking it in support of graduate work, your job, general interest, or something else?

This is general interest. I am taking the non-thesis route for a master's in software engineering. The 2 concetrated paths I fought between were big data and parallelization. Since I was decided ultimately GPU processing was more interesting, it won!

# 3. Do you have a scientific / research code in your graduate work, employment, or personal pet projects that you would like to accelerate?

Sadly, I do not. I work as a software engineer at Northrop Grumman.

# 4. What experience do you have in C, C++, and CUDA?

I used to tutor C++. So I have more experience in it than C or CUDA. Last time I used C was last semester where I needed to create an echo/response program in a client/server architecture. CUDA is brand new to me and have no experience in it.

# 5. What experience do you have using MPI?

Not a ton. The CPE513 course had projects in it but that was a year or 2 ago. However, from taking Advanced Operating Systems with Dr. Booth, I was exposed to the importance (and difficulty) of managing messages in MPI because all of them can talk to each other. It differs from typical RPC (remote procedure call) messages because every message in MPI can be a server or a client, whereas RPC usually has 1 client and 1 server at a time. 

# 6. What experience do you have using OpenMP?

I don't have much experience at all.

# 7. What is the most complex software project you've worked on?



# 8. What experience do you have with git version control?

Alot of experience. I was assigned a job at one point in my career to strictly resolve merge conflicts between teams.

# 9. What experience do you have with Make?

4 months of experience. Dr. Booth in Adv Operating Systems last semester had us write our own Make files.

# 10. What experience do you have with the Alabama Supercomputing Authority machines?

The CPE513 class required us to make accounts, submit jobs to the SLURM queue, and report results.

# 11. Do you prefer working individually or in a group on your semester project?

Prefer individual for this class because I'm going on a trip to Japan in March for 2 weeks. I don't want to cause any conflict of schedule with anyone so it may be best to work alone this time around. Other than that, I'd totally be team oriented.

# 12. What experience do you have in numerical linear algebra (theory, see e.g., Golub and Van Loan) and using numerical linear algebra libraries (e.g., BLAS, LAPACK, MKL, etc.)?

I took a linear algebra class and understood the significance of eigenvalues at one point. Basic matrix operations by hand as well. No experience with programming libraries of linear algebra. I do remember saying "Wow, this is super useful" during the course alot though. 

# 13. What is your area of study, along with any specialization? If you have an advisor or research topic, please share. I'd love to get to know your background better so if you have any other information you'd like to share, please include it here.

I'll probably attach my resume. At the moment I'm studying distributed systems because my job is starting to require it again.
